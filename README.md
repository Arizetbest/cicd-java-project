# CI/CD Java Project 

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Java application deployed on AWS. It showcases how modern DevOps practices can automate build, test, and deployment processes while improving reliability, visibility, and scalability.

# Project Overview

The application is a lightweight Java HTTP server built with Maven. The CI/CD pipeline integrates AWS services to automatically build and deploy the application to EC2 instances.

The goal of this project is to eliminate manual deployment steps and implement a repeatable, production-style deployment workflow.

# Architecture

The pipeline uses:

GitHub – Source code repository

AWS CodePipeline – Orchestrates the CI/CD workflow

AWS CodeBuild – Builds the Maven project

AWS CodeDeploy – Deploys the application to EC2

Amazon EC2 – Hosts the running application

IAM – Secure role-based access control

# Application

The Java application:

Runs on port 8080

Exposes a root endpoint (/)

Provides a health check endpoint (/health)

Is packaged using Maven

Build artifact generation is handled via pom.xml
